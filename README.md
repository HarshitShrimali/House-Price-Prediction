# House-Price-Prediction
Kaggle Competition House Price Prediction using Pytorch and Tensorflow

Compare RandomForest, XGBoost, and Neural Network for tabular data by predicting house prices.
  1. Performed Data Cleaning and Normalization data. 
  2. Select Important features (Columns)
  3. Trained RandomForest and XGBoost model after parameter tuning for better results
  4. Used Neural Network using Pytorch and Tensorflow to check does Neural Network perform better than Random Forest/XGboost for tabular data or not?
  5. We found that Random Forest/XGboost outperforms Neural Network for Tabular Data
